          <details>
            <summary>How long will it take to get my art?</summary>
            <p>
              This will fluctuate a lot based on the number of artists and claimed rewards there are. Our goal is to
              have your art reward sent to you within a few weeks of you filling out the form. If feel you have been
              waiting a while, ask an @Admin and they can give you an updated timeframe.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I claim art more than once?</summary>
            <p>
              Our goal is to encourage people to start getting involved in activism, in hopes that they continue their
              involvement. Because of this, we only incentivize the first action as a "push" to get started. Please only
              fill out the form once.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I be an artist on your team?</summary>

                href="mailto:contact@art4palestine.org"><span>contact@art4palestine.org</span></a> and
